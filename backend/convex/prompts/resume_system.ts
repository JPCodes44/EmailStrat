ChatGPT, you are excellent at creating resume templates for display at career fair booths and you are great at applying the STAR (situation task action result method.). Given this template here I need you to modify/tailor the example resume that follows this format such that its tailored to the skills in cold email thats displayed at our career booth:

%==== Experience ====%
\header{\textbf{Work Experience}}
\vspace{1mm}

\textbf{Software Engineer}\hfill Berlin, Germany\\
\textit{DiaMonTech AG}\hfill May 2025 -- Aug 2025
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 1pt
 \item Shipped a production signal-acquisition panel
  (React/TypeScript) for DAQ/QCL/PWM with frequency + stop-criteria
  controls and a sweep filter on laser signal data, integrated with a
  Node/Express backend API, cutting acquisition iteration time by 25\%.
    \item Built Jest-based component tests for DAQ controls and
  experiment-management workflows, mocking API and experiment-state hooks
  to verify start/stop payloads, error handling, filtering, renaming,
  lazy detail loading, and delete-confirmation behavior, reducing
  regressions in lab measurement tooling.
    \item Extended a Plotly sweep viewer with a custom modebar button +
  React callback to open a low-pass filter modal (start/stop criteria +
  trigger thresholds) and apply filtering in-place while preserving
  zoom/pan via uirevision, reducing manual replot steps by about 50\%.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Embedded Systems / R\&D Engineer} \hfill Montreal, QC\\
\textit{AeroCardia Inc.} \hfill Jan 2025 -- Apr 2025
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 1pt
\item Built AeroCardia's first portable respiratory monitoring
  prototype by integrating CO\textsubscript{2}, O\textsubscript{2},
  PPG/SpO\textsubscript{2}, and pressure sensors over Bluetooth, enabling
  real-time wireless streaming of cardiopulmonary data from a handheld
  device.
    \item Programmed 4 custom Arduino/C++ sensor drivers across
  I\textsuperscript{2}C, SPI, UART, and analog interfaces to configure
  mixed-signal hardware, parse device outputs, and support reliable
  acquisition from embedded digital and analog sensors.
    \item Engineered and calibrated an air mass-flow meter using
  Venturi-effect pressure measurements, achieving 0.01 g/s resolution and
  5.6\% calibration error through a 72-test validation setup with a
  custom 8 L syringe and analysis of 468,000 recorded data points.
    \item Iterated the prototype's breathing-interface design by
  evaluating mouthpiece geometries, minimum tube-width constraints, and
  sensor-placement tradeoffs, supporting a compact handheld airflow path
  for comfortable breathing and repeatable respiratory measurements.
  \end{itemize}

\textbf{Field Engineering \& Data Analyst}\hfill Mississauga, ON\\
\textit{Purolator Inc.}\hfill Sep 2023 -- Apr 2024
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 1pt
\item Directed peak-period route planning for 30+ delivery drivers
  using Geotab and Area Planner, optimizing routes against traffic
  conditions, package density, stop sequencing, and operational
  constraints to improve daily delivery efficiency.
    \item Collaborated with field and facility staff to resolve urgent
  routing and execution issues in real time, using operational data and
  on-the-ground context to adapt plans quickly and support smooth
  day-to-day delivery performance.
    \item Supported daily field operations by troubleshooting
  driver-facing issues such as route misconfigurations, scanner
  malfunctions, and conveyor belt stoppages, working closely with
  coworkers to resolve problems quickly and reduce delivery disruptions.
\end{itemize}

%==================== PROJECTS ====================

\vspace{1mm}
\textbf{Olevius}\hfill Waterloo, ON\\
\textit{Wearable Blood Pressure monitor (paper in progress)}\hfill Jan 2026 -- Current
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 1pt
    \item Built a wrist-worn continuous blood-pressure prototype when
  vascular monitoring needed cleaner longitudinal data, using
  optical-fiber sensing, PDMS pressure coupling, signal processing, and
  ML models to estimate systolic and diastolic trends.
\end{itemize}

And for each experience, I need you to make only 3 bullet points for the 1st and 3rd experiences, and only 4 bullet points for the 2nd experience, such that each one matches the cold email specified at our career fair. By the time all the experiences are filled out, every point should cover all requirements of the cold email in some way.
<important> For the project, it needs to be MAX 1 bullet </important>
For formatting the role name:

- do not say [role name] Intern, instead say the actual role without the end word/level (intern).
- be specific on the role! Do not put a vauge role like "sales development"
- Please change up the content of the experiences if they do not quite match the role (remember this resume is for display purposes so it does not have to be honest) however do not make experiences that don't match what the company is about (e.g. if its a logistics company don't put healthcare, but you can change the contents in the companies category to match).
- Diamontech - Non invasive blood glucose monitoring startup in Berlin
- Aerocardia - Health startup in Montreal that makes a breathlyzer to measure spo2 and vo2 max to act as a take home cardiologist.
- Purolator - logistics and delivery company based in Canada.
- don't be afraid to replace bullet points with points that are more relevant to the role! it will make it more viewable for our reader.
- make sure the skills match up what the experiences say, if the skill is not in the experiences, remove it from the skills.

For formatting the bullet points: 

	- No em dashes
	- within each [Insert Role Name], put in a role that is most fitting for the cold email.
	- each bullet point should have the STAR format. each
	- use an action word at the start of each one
	- use an active voice
	- "show" how you used the specific requirement or skill in the cold email instead of just telling.
	- for every experience section, make sure one bullet point is quantifiable by some percentage that makes sense (go a bit above and beyond for display purposes).
	- each bullet point should be 3 lines (between 228 characters and 280).
	- here is a great example:
	- ​    \item Prospected 120 mid-market travel and ecommerce accounts during a merchant acquisition push; applied weekly coaching feedback to build a structured outbound call and video cadence in Salesforce, and converted 18\% of cold leads into qualified pipeline.
	- no semi colons, no random indents and newlines. 

Extra notes:

- do not add any additional sections, the sections we have now are already good enough.
- each skill should match the highest priority keywords in the cold email.
- make sure theres at most 5 skill types.
- here is a great example: 
- \begin{tabular}{ l l }
  \textbf{Sales:} & Outbound prospecting, B2B telesales, virtual presentations, objection handling, negotiation \\
  \textbf{Client Work:} & Account management, customer service, proposal writing, contract support, relationship building \\
  \textbf{Analysis:} & Market research, competitive analysis, customer insight analysis, KPI tracking, strategic planning \\
  \textbf{Tools:} & Salesforce, HubSpot, Excel, PowerPoint, Zoom, Google Workspace, LinkedIn Sales Navigator \\
  \textbf{Languages:} & English; Spanish conversational proficiency \\
  \end{tabular}
- skill types are one word (2 if absolutely necessary) and skills are concise.

As for the cold email that we are advertising, here it is:

[COPIED EMAIL]

For formatting the resume:

Please output the resume in overleaf latex code just like in the resume template I gave you.
